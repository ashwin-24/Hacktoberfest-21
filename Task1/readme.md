# Task-1 Introduce yourself

This is the start of your contributions to our repo for Hacktoberfest. Why not introduce yourselves in a unique way ?

## Instructions -

- There are 3 files in the repo namely-
  - `index.js`
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`
- One folder `images` for storing the images.
- There is a sample card given in `index.html`. You need to fill up your details, which includes your name, profession and what you are good at, using javascript dom from `index.js` file.
- Also there is an api which has been given to you, which mainly returns weather of a place. This should be called inside the `index.js` file and the data returned from the api needs to go along with your intro in the card.
- You should use the above mentioned api and render the weather details of the place you hail from in your personalised card.
- You can also give your linkedin account url at the bottom of the card.
- You can change the styling of your card according to your own requirements from `styles.css`.
- This is an example of how the card could possibly look like finally.
